*** Update load() to manager(), its because the functionality is only to load manager widget so I have to specify the name to manager() not in general load() because its is not made to load any widget of anything else just manager widget. - Retain load() because this should be overidden in the specific module from php and js to load any widget.

*** If logout or incative user change url to cms.com/login/ and title to Log-in then after logging-in use referer variable to redirect to the recent page. - Not necessary.

*** theme.js.php redundant responses like this function
  function form_height_load(){
    if(form_current()){
      form_height('form');
      form_height('form1');
      form_height('form2');
      form_height('form3');
      $('.form_load_div .option').tooltip('show');
    }
  }
it change the height of all forms, this should be change to specific, identify what is the active/current form then only change the height of the active/current form not all forms to avoid redundant response and optimize the page ajax reponse/load. In this way site/system will become faster. - Done.

*** In search box trigger only ajax after stopped typing for 1, 2 or 3 secs. - Done.

*** Make logic and script to load database when project is hit and load table if module is hit. - Done.

*** Optimize sql class to prevent opening db connection even if not needed e.g. if using $sql->fetch or $sql->count for my understanding that functions is working even without db connection. - Done.

*** Auto focus is not working in chosen element. To replicate the issue add user, just leave the cursor on Confirm field and hit enter, you will notice that the cursor is not moved to chosen element. - Done.

*** All module classes should have the same name. - Done.

*** Fix setup guide and finalize setup process. - Done.

*** Fix ckeditor because its not working. - Inprogress, search how to put the cursor on CKEditor. - Done.

*** Fix missing argument warnings. - Done.

*** Fix ckeditor required field validation to make it working with multiple inside the form and also with multiple forms. - Done.

*** Replace all require_once with include because include is faster, require_once has checking logic if the file is already included. - Done.

*** Check all functions like below, because it has switch but only using default case.
function field_switch($field_name){
  switch($field_name){
    default:
      $this->field_arr[] = $field_name;
    break;
  }
} - Done.

*** Not scrolling up when form has image to upload, review why I make it like this. For now I guess its nice if this is scrolling up. - Done.

*** Fix issue in function url and upload variable value when using same domain. - Done.

*** Chosen validation for required field is not working if action is update then chosen is empty.
  Explanation: The field is empty bacause the value of the selected option is blank, but actually it has a selected option if you inspect the element, that is why required field is not working. But I fixed it anyway by updating the line below.
  From   : <?php if($sel == $val){ echo 'selected'; } ?>
  To     : <?php if($sel == $val && $arr_opt[$index]){ echo 'selected'; } ?>
  by adding  && $arr_opt[$index]. - Done.

*** Fix js missing arguments, no error sbut this should be fix to be standard. - Done.

*** Fix file upload feature to make it working with multiple forms because currently as far as I remember it is only working for multiple element inside the form. - Done.

*** Auto log out if user dont have activity on site. - Done.

*** Remove Ckeditor because of the following issues:
    - Not working properly.
    - Required field validation is not working.
  Just have to add it manually if needed because this is a burden and a huge blocker on the Skull development. - Done.

*** Make this framework load only class methods, css and js for a specific widget or element if it is being used. Example if I dont use file upload element then the codes for file upload element should not be load. This is to optimize the page load.

The above leads to page load performance issue because of having too many injecting process that is why I realized to just inject only the major libraries (js and css) not every js and css of a specific element. - Done.

*** Enable SSL using 443 vhost setup. - Done.

*** Make the post and get values encrypted. Make a process like an SSL approach. - Done.

*** Submit only if form has changes if none, just a div saying that no changes to save. - Done.

*** Place signout script accordingly to solve 'Uncaught ReferenceError: signout is not defined' issue. - Done.

*** Update timeout to x3 for FormValBefore because it causes error in online deployment. - Done.

*** Do not scroll up if single upload. - Done.

*** Add url to anchor tags to identify the link before clicking. - Done.

*** Updated upload js to use only [] instead of new Array to make it simple. - Done.

Todo:
---
*** Create a function for the repeated js like .submit and .keyup scripts so it won't be displayed in the page source one by one each element and place it on skull/theme.js. Use unique function in skull/theme.js for username and email checking if existing instead of using ajax_unique_val function in skull/field.php - Done.

*** Move submit validation to theme.js - Done.

*** Move the upload image display to a separate function to reuse it. - Done.

*** Fix datepicker, sometimes it does not working. - Done.

*** Fix chosen, sometimes it does not working. - Done.

*** Remove autocomplete in datepicket textbox, but autocomplete="off" all textbox. - Done.

*** Checked all files, all are using ANSI encoding except for config.php it uses UTF-8, I intentionally set it because of Peso symbol. Change Peso sign with HTML Entity and change the encoding of config.php to ANSI. Change symbol to currency. - Done.

*** Fix measure to adjust to '0' if decimal is not '00' then tridown click. Currently it stop on '1'. - Done.

*** Fix amount has issue in validation, submiting even its value is 0.00 and also has issue in encryption because of the Peso symbol. - Done.

*** Setup sublime, see photo of sublime settings in phone. - Done.

*** Use two spaces for coding indentation. Opened all files to replace tabs with spaces and also search white spaces that does not needed. Below are the string searched every file.

'}
 ', '} ', '; ', '> ', '{ ', '*/ ', ', ', '. ', '( '

 Last, git diff and look for red means white spaces and remove one by one except for spec classes that are empty. - Done.

*** Sanitized form functions both PHP and JS. - Done.

*** Create functions for '#'+form+'_form #'+variable+'_input_field', 'Please fill out this field.' and 'Please fill out this field with an email.'. This is to sanitize theme.js. - Done.

*** Created function for '#'+form+'_form #password_input_field', '#'+form+'_form #'+variable+'_prev_'+id and created generic function for actions like load, search, limit and etc. - Done.

*** Use only one script tag for a specific component and moved html.php function form_close js to theme and named it as first() because the function about focus on the very first element in a form. - Done.

*** Use localStorage for display limit.

*** Add sort feature in tables.

*** Cancel should also clear preview images in upload input and clear ckeditor texts. Find function cancel(form) in theme then add the needed scripts.

*** Try loading the assets like chosen.js or chosen.css without using inject function, just load it directly as html script.

*** Check active and inactive if it is waiting for ajax response. This should not wait just update from x to check and vise versa to avoid loading the whole data again every click.

*** Use localStorage for active or inactive fields that customizes table display so every user can custom their table set or display.

*** Update plug/custom to plug/theme

*** Update skullframework/cms to skullframework/app

*** Change structure, pattern it from skull js, but maybe retain the htaccess and version location inside cms/ because of the share directory (uploaded files).

*** Try to analyse making the page as widget.

*** Update datepicket to datetimepicker.

*** In settings page should have the option to select backed up databases. I think it can be a dropdwon then set the selected to localStorage if also accessible in php if not use cookie or phpsession. Delete the localStorage or cookie or phpsession if selected back to the latest database so the default in config will be used. This means a condition should be added if database localStorage or cookie or phpsession exist or not blank then use the database name that is set in that localStorage or cookie or phpsession.

*** Extend table functions to add multiple selection to delete using checkbox.

*** Add datetimepicker from and to and add field in user form, to have time limit for user access.

*** Separate config for dev, staging, preprod and production.

*** Dev instance creation easy process and staging, preprod and production deployment easy process.

*** Create Documentation Page and link to Docs under Temp tab.
