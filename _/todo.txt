*** Update load() to manager(), its because the functionality is only to load manager widget so I have to specify the name to manager() not in general load() because its is not made to load any widget of anything else just manager widget. - Retain load() because this should be overidden in the specific module from php and js to load any widget.

*** If logout or incative user change url to cms.com/login/ and title to Log-in then after logging-in use referer variable to redirect to the recent page. - Not necessary.

*** theme.js.php redundant responses like this function
	function form_height_load(){
		if(form_current()){
			form_height('form');
			form_height('form1');
			form_height('form2');
			form_height('form3');
			$('.form_load_div .option').tooltip('show');
		}
	}
it change the height of all forms, this should be change to specific, identify what is the active/current form then only change the height of the active/current form not all forms to avoid redundant response and optimize the page ajax reponse/load. In this way site/system will become faster. - Done.

*** In search box trigger only ajax after stopped typing for 1, 2 or 3 secs. - Done.

*** Make logic and script to load database when project is hit and load table if module is hit. - Done.

*** Optimize sql class to prevent opening db connection even if not needed e.g. if using $sql->fetch or $sql->count for my understanding that functions is working even without db connection. - Done.

*** Auto focus is not working in chosen element. To replicate the issue add user, just leave the cursor on Confirm field and hit enter, you will notice that the cursor is not moved to chosen element. - Done.

*** All module classes should have the same name. - Done.

*** Fix setup guide and finalize setup process. - Done.

*** Fix ckeditor because its not working. - Inprogress, search how to put the cursor on CKEditor. - Done.

Todo:
---
*** Fix missing argument warnings. - Done.

*** Fix ckeditor required field validation to make it working with multiple inside the form and also with multiple forms. - Done.

*** Replace all require_once with include because include is faster, require_once has checking logic if the file is already included. - Done.

*** Check all functions like below, because it has switch but only using default case.
function field_switch($field_name){
	switch($field_name){
		default:
			$this->field_arr[] = $field_name;
		break;
	}
} - Done.

*** Not scrolling up when form has image to upload, review why I make it like this. For now I guess its nice if this is scrolling up. - Done.

*** Fix issue in function url and upload variable value when using same domain. - Done.

*** Fix ckeditor, not working properly.

*** Fix file upload feature to make it working with multiple forms because currently as far as I remember it is only working for multiple element inside the form.

*** Make this framework load only class methods, css and js for a specific widget or element if it is being used. Example if I dont use file upload element then the codes for file upload element should not be load. This is to optimize the page load.

*** Auto log out if user dont have activity on site.

*** Create Documentation Page and link to Docs under Temp tab.
